# Menagerie
## Version

## About
This program creates a game called Menagerie, where the user controls a cannon that shoots at critters/inchworms. The main objective of the game is to kill these critters before they reach the cannon, or you will lose. I created this in my 2430 Data Structures class. The files I created have my name at the top, the rest the instructor has provided.


## Dependancies
This Menagerie project has all the provided parts to compile and run.
